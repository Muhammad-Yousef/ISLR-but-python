# ISLR-but-python

This repository contains labs and applied exercises rewritten in Python for the book <A target="_blank" href='http://www-bcf.usc.edu/%7Egareth/ISL/index.html'>'An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R'</A> by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani (2013).<P>.

For the labs, the text in the Jupyter notebooks is taken from the book, adapted to the Python code where necessary.

Some of this is inspired by https://github.com/gperaza/ISLR-Python-Labs, who has done a wonderful job adapting the labs to Python. I have made some modifications where I thought I could improve on it.
