# ISLR-but-python
Hi there!
This repository contains labs rewritten in Python for the book <A target="_blank" href='https://www.statlearning.com/'>'An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R'</A> by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani (2013).<P>. The book is freely available to download at the above link. There is also an [online course](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/sohs-ystatslearning-statistical-learning) based on the book if you are interested.

For the labs, the text in the Jupyter notebooks is taken from the book, adapted to the Python code where necessary. I have mainly used `statsmodels`, `sklearn` and `scipy` packages for the ML models, and `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for the plotting.

I have also included some handwritten notes to the chapters (good luck with my handwriting) and solutions to the conceptual exercises, which are at the end of the notes for the respective chapters.
